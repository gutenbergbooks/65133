<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> little time ago, when one of our most distinguished
botanists was asked his opinion about
the desirability of forming a collection of all the
vegetable substances which are or have been used
in medicine both by civilised and savage races, he
replied that it would take a large building to hold
it. Although a series of fibre-yielding plants
would be much less in number, the list would still
be a long one, provided we knew all those in use
by savage tribes. Very few of these, however,
are extensively used for clothing. Putting aside
wool and silk, which are animal products, we have
only cotton and flax of prime importance. Hemp
of fine quality is largely grown in Italy, and there
woven into cloth for ordinary purposes; but as
yet this use of hemp in other civilised countries
appears to be limited, though the fibre is everywhere
employed for cordage. With the exception
of jute, which is chiefly made into coarse fabrics,
all other vegetable fibres believed to be suitable
for important textile industries may be said to
be as yet only on their trial. But a number—such
as the so-called New Zealand flax (<i>Phormium
tenax</i>), Manila hemp (<i>Musa textilis</i>), pine-apple
(<i>Bromelia ananas</i>), American aloe (<i>Agave Americana</i>),
and some yielded by certain species of
palms—are known to possess very valuable properties.
We have omitted to mention any members
of the Nettle tribe—to which, however, the
hemp-plant is closely allied—as we propose to
say a few special words about them.</p>

<p>Growing both wild and cultivated in suitable
localities scattered over a large area in South-eastern
Asia, there is a species of nettle to which
a peculiar interest is attached. The reason of this
is that the liber or inner side of its bark yields a
fibre excelling every other derived from the vegetable
kingdom for fineness, strength, and lustre combined.
In China, this fibre is called by English-speaking
people, China grass; in India it is called
<i>rhea</i>; and in the Malayan Archipelago by the name
of <i>ramie</i>. It was some time before botanists discovered
that the material which was known in
commerce by three different names was the produce
of the same plant—a stingless nettle. For more
than half a century, much attention has now
been devoted to the <i>Urtica nivea</i> or <i>Bœhmeria nivea</i>
(a newer name), as the China grass plant is called
in scientific language. Long in use in China and
Japan for making ropes and cloth—much of the
latter being of very fine quality—it was introduced
into England for manufacturing purposes soon
after Mr Fortune the well-known botanist returned
in 1846 from his travels in China. Small quantities
had, however, been sent to England long
before this. Even as early as 1810, some bales of
the Indian-grown fibre were received at the India
House, London, and its great strength as a rope-making
material ascertained. Indeed, it is stated
on high authority, that this fibre has been in use
in the Netherlands since the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In Messrs Marshall’s great flax-mill at Leeds,
China grass was spun to some extent for about ten
years after 1851, and its snow-white silky yarn is
more or less constantly in use in some kinds of
Bradford fabrics. But unlike the jute fibre, which
has created in the course of a single generation a
gigantic industry, the trade in China grass has
scarcely advanced at all. The value of the latter
is admitted on all hands; there is practically an
unlimited demand for it; plenty of it could be
grown in India, and yet it is not cultivated to any
extent. This is solely owing to the great amount
of manual labour required to separate the fibre
and bark from the stem, and then the fibre from
the bark, no machine having been yet invented
which will do this at once efficiently and cheaply.</p>

<p>The Indian government have long been vexed
that the latent wealth of the plant yielding this
much-prized rhea fibre cannot be realised. In
1869 they offered a prize of five thousand pounds
for the best, and another of two thousand pounds
for the second-best machine which would separate
and prepare the fibre, at a cost of fifteen pounds
per ton in India, in such a way that it would
fetch fifty pounds per ton in England. It may
here be mentioned that it sometimes sells as high
as eighty pounds per ton, and even higher; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">{146}</span>
the highest price for jute rarely exceeds twenty-five
pounds, and for flax of fine quality, forty
pounds. Naturally, the Indian administration
hoped that the offer of these handsome prizes
would bring forward as competitors some of the
ablest machinists in Europe. But whether it was
owing to the inherent difficulty of the problem,
to the expense of taking out heavy machines to
India, or to that apathy with which it is frequently
said we in this country regard everything
Indian, practically nothing came of the competition.
Mr John Greig of Edinburgh sent a machine
for trial which so far met the conditions that
he received a douceur of fifteen hundred pounds.
About thirty competitors applied to have their
machines tried; but eventually Mr Greig alone
put in an appearance. It was found that by his
method it cost fully fifteen pounds per ton to prepare
the fibre in India; and when this was sent
to London, it was valued at only twenty-eight
pounds per ton.</p>

<p>In 1875, Dr Forbes Watson—one of a small
band of scientific men who have done much to
bring under notice the industrial resources of
India—suggested that, in order to save the expense
of freight, trials of machines should be made in
England instead of India. Green stems of the
plant grown in the south of France were promised
for the purpose; and towards the end of that year,
several inventors had entered their machines for
competition; but owing to unforeseen difficulties,
it was found impossible to hold the trials. Unwilling
to abandon the hope of attaining their
great object, the government of India issued a
new notification to inventors in 1877. This time
the prizes offered were five thousand pounds
for the best, and one thousand pounds for the
second-best machine or process for preparing rhea
fibre which would be worth forty-five pounds
per ton in London, at a cost of not more than
fifteen pounds per ton laid down at any port
of shipment in India. The trials having been
arranged to take place, as before, at Saháranpur
in September 1879, ten competitors appeared;
but only seven had their machines tested. When
the fibre prepared by each arrived in London,
it was found that the highest value put upon
any of the samples was twenty-six pounds per
ton. Accordingly, none of the competitors could
claim the full amount of either of the prizes;
but Messrs Van der Ploeg and Nagoua, two textile
machinists well known on the continent, were
each awarded five hundred pounds, and Mr
Cameron one hundred pounds. On the failure
of this second competition, it was determined
not to renew the offer of a prize until it could
be proved by private enterprise that the rhea
plant could be cultivated with profit in India.
The unfavourable reports on the best samples
prepared at the second trial at Saháranpur seem
to have convinced the Indian government that
at present the prospect of producing Indian rhea
which would successfully compete with the fibre
of the same plant grown and prepared in China,
is not very hopeful.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this second failure on the part
of the government of India to obtain by rewards
a machine capable of turning the cultivation of
the rhea plant in that country into a commercial
success, so confident are many good judges of the
great value of China grass as a textile material,
that the interest in it is increasing from year to
year. Its cultivation is spreading over Southern
Europe, considerable areas being now laid out into
plantations of China grass in Italy and the south
of France. Spain and Portugal are beginning
to grow it; and on the south side of the
Mediterranean, Algiers and Egypt are also moving
in the same direction. It is believed that this
recent development of ramie culture in the
Mediterranean region—to call the plant by the
name our French neighbours appear to prefer—is
to some extent owing to Favier’s recent method
of treating the fibre, the patent for which is
owned by a Company located at Avignon. This
plan is very simple, and considering how much
the use of steam—we do not mean as a motive
force—has quickened many processes, even in
the textile industries, it is wonderful that it
had not been thought of before. M. Favier
merely exposes the stems of the plant to the
action of steam for about twenty minutes in a
closed wooden trough, after which the bark and
fibre are easily stripped from the stem. By the
retting process, or steeping in cold water, it takes
days, sometimes weeks, to effect the decortication
of the stems; and we have seen how difficult it
has been found to do this by machinery. But
although M. Favier’s process greatly simplifies
matters in this early stage of the preparation of
the fibre, the gummy substance and outer skin
still require to be removed from it.</p>

<p>Only the other day, it was announced that Professor
Frémy, a distinguished French chemist, has,
after an elaborate series of experiments, found out
a method of readily separating the fibre from these
extraneous matters. He takes up the ribbons of
bark with attached fibre, as obtained by M.
Favier’s plan, and subjects them to a peculiar
treatment, which mainly consists in boiling them
under pressure in an alkaline solution. During
the operation, everything deleterious is removed
from the useful portion of the fibre, which is then
ready for the ordinary operation of the spinner.
There seems good grounds for believing that the
combined processes of Messrs Favier and Frémy,
which are about to be tried on a scale of some
magnitude in France, will prove a commercial
success. It will be curious to watch the future
history of a plant which has so long baffled
every attempt to raise it into conspicuous importance
as an article of commerce, about which
volumes have been written, and the fibre of
which is now well known by its valuable
properties to those engaged in textile industries
in every civilised country.</p>

<p>There is another Indian nettle, called <i>Urtica
heterophylla</i>, which produces a strong, fine, white,
glossy fibre. Best known by the name of the
Neilgherry nettle, it is nevertheless widely
diffused over India. The stem, branches, and
leaves are covered with stiff sharp bristles, which
give it a formidable, or, as some say, a ferocious
appearance. These also inflict acute pain if they
should happen to be touched, but fortunately the
effect of the sting soon passes away. The prepared
fibre of this plant is sometimes called vegetable
wool; and it is better suited, from its appearance,
for mixing with real wool than rhea fibre, which
has been a good deal used for this purpose. In
some parts of India, the fibre of the Neilgherry
nettle is used by the natives in the manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">{147}</span>
of cloth. It has been partially experimented upon
for textile purposes in England; but there seems
to have been a difference of opinion as to its
merits. Owing to its sting, there are even greater
difficulties in separating its fibre than is the case
with rhea; but these might be overcome by some
mechanical or chemical treatment. It is a quick-growing
plant, and could be cultivated to any
extent, should a demand for it arise.</p>

<p>We must pass over other species of <i>urtica</i>, and
come to the common stinging nettle of Europe.
As is well known, this plant furnishes a nutritious
food for swine and some other animals,
and in Scotland is occasionally used for making
a kind of soup termed nettle kail; and in
default of a better, its roots will furnish, along
with alum, a yellow dye. The tenacity of its
fibre has long been known. It has been woven
into cloth in past times, but no doubt only on a
limited scale, in nearly every country where the
plant grows. Nor have its properties as a textile
material been altogether overlooked in modern
times, at least in the British Islands, since lace,
parasol covers, and other fancy articles made of
common nettle fibre have been on exhibition in
the Museums of Economic Botany at Kew and
Dublin for the last thirty years, besides having
been occasionally brought under the notice of the
public in various other ways. At Dresden, Herr
F. C. Seidel has recently established a manufactory
for nettle-cloth, in which, according to
what seems to be an authentic report, he uses
fibre of the common species; but the significant
remark is added, that he prefers to get his
material from the Chinese nettle.</p>

<p>Some persons think that they see a great nettle
industry looming in the future, if only a process
of readily separating the useless parts of its stem
without injuring the fibre could be discovered.
We are of course speaking of the common nettle.
A statement has been published which one can
very readily believe—namely, that the profitable
extraction of its fibre is possible only when it is
cultivated. In the wild state, the plant is
branchy; but when grown on suitable soil at
regular distances of from five to eight inches
apart, it forms single stems from four to fully
seven feet high. Even if they would serve
as well as cultivated plants, and could be economically
gathered from many widely scattered
localities, all the wild nettles growing in our
waste places and old churchyards would be a
bagatelle in the sense of furnishing material for
many large spinning-mills.</p>

<p>Whatever sanguine people may think, other
things besides skilful cultivation and an easy
process of preparing the fibre will determine
whether nettle crops will be profitable; or, to
put the matter in another way, whether a great
industry is likely to be established by the manufacture
of nettle-cloth. There is no difficulty in
cultivating or in dressing flax, nor any lack
of demand for it; yet shrewd Scotch farmers
have found out that other crops are more profitable,
and therefore the blue-blossomed flax
fields which many of us saw in our boyhood in
Central Fife and the Lowlands of Scotland have
entirely disappeared. If nettle-cloth is ever to
be anything but a curiosity, it will require to
have attractions in quality and price which will
enable it to compete with other textiles. During
the American civil war, the jute-mills of Dundee
were turning out many thousands of yards of cheap
but serviceable fabrics to be used instead of calico,
because the cost of the latter had gone up a little.
For some of the purposes to which it was applied,
the jute did as well as the cotton. But the war
having ended, calico of a certain ‘make’ and
quality became once more a trifle cheaper than
its rival, and so jute was quickly beaten out of
the field again. This is an example of the kind of
battle which any fibre new to commerce will have
to fight, unless it possesses some property of quite
exceptional value.</p>

<p>To many persons, it seems a pity that we
cannot utilise a plant which yields something
useful. But the nettle is by no means the most
striking example of a native plant which might
be and yet is not used in the arts. One or two
species of fern, such as the common bracken, are
greatly more abundant in this country than the
nettle—whole hillsides in many districts being
covered with them. Yet although a very serviceable
paper can be made from ferns, paper manufacturers
prefer to send to the shores of the
Mediterranean for a species of wild grass to supply
their mills. For several years past, an ingenious
Glasgow chemist has been trying to make a marketable
gum or jelly from the common seaweed,
thrown up in great abundance on the western
coasts of Scotland. We hope he may succeed; but
meanwhile we are sending elsewhere for what we
require of seaweed jelly—even to far Japan. The
peat-mosses of Ireland—and of Scotland too, for
that matter—would furnish an endless number of
beautiful paraffin candles, if some great Company
with limited liability would only take the
business up—and make the candles at a trifling
loss per pound.</p>

<p>Some of our readers will probably suppose that
we have given them a too humble estimate of
the value of the common nettle as a textile material.
There is no denying the fact that the
tenacity of its cortical fibres is scarcely if at all
inferior to those of flax or hemp. But how to
grow, spin, and weave them into a saleable cloth,
is a problem which has not yet been solved. Just
now, there is a partial revival of what may be
almost called the ancient art of manufacturing
hand-made paper for printed books. In these
days, too, many of the fair sex have apparently
discovered that embroidery when worked by
hand is really more interesting and beautiful
than when it is done by a machine, supposing
that in both cases the design is of nearly equal
merit. It seems also to be dawning on many
persons that earthenware dishes painted by the
fingers have, even when a little dauby, a kind
of attraction about them not possessed by those
which have their patterns printed from an
engraved copper-plate, and are therefore all rigidly
alike. Possibly, ‘fashion’ may carry matters a
little farther in this direction, and revive the
use of textile fabrics spun by the distaff and
spindle, and woven on handlooms. But by the
help of machinery, the labour of one woman can
nowadays make clothing for more than a thousand
others. A hundred years ago, nearly every woman
had to spin the material required for the clothing
of her family; but at that same time, or at least
not long before it, those in the upper ranks had
a knowledge of many useful and ingenious arts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">{148}</span>
which they no longer possess. If it were possible
but in part to resuscitate the state of matters
which obtained in these old days, before spinning-jennies,
or powerlooms, or lace-making machines
were dreamed of, there would be fully more hope
than there is of people keeping themselves warm
by an external application of the stinging nettle,
in a less heroic way than we are told the Romans
did of old.</p>

<p>Nettle-cloth is undoubtedly an excellent fabric,
but—Will it pay the manufacturer? The answer
to this is, Not yet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.—LIGHT HEARTS AND SAD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> buzz of conversation continued as the party
descended the broad staircase.</p>

<p>‘Rather bad of Phil to keep us waiting all this
time,’ said Coutts as he gave Madge his arm.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he could not help it,’ she suggested.</p>

<p>‘Ah, perhaps not. But you see Wrentham
hasn’t turned up yet either, and I daresay they
have been lunching together,’ rejoined Coutts
with a smile, which was to her a very unpleasant
one.</p>

<p>They had only taken their places at table, when
Philip and Wrentham quietly entered. There
was an agreeable murmur of satisfaction at the
arrival of the gentleman in whose honour they
had met, and his greeting was as cordial as if
nobody were hungry on his account.</p>

<p>No one except Madge appeared to observe the
singular alteration in his appearance. He was
pale, his eyes seemed heavy like those of one
wakening from sleep, and the smile with which
he responded to the welcome of his friends was
forced—his expression altogether unlike what she
had expected it to be. His walk, too, was that of
one who was carefully measuring each step. For
an instant, the ugly suggestion of his brother, that
he had been taking too much wine at lunch,
occurred to her.</p>

<p>He took his seat by her side; dinner proceeded.
Presently general conversation was resumed, and
the cause of the temporary delay of the banquet
appeared to be forgotten.</p>

<p>But to Madge the brilliant light of the room
and the merriment around them only made that
pale-faced man beside her the more unlike
Philip.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry I could not get here sooner,’ he
said in an undertone, and his voice sounded
unusually feeble.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Philip? Why are you so
pale?’</p>

<p>‘You cannot expect me to be taking leave of
all my friends without feeling queer,’ he answered
with an attempt to smile.</p>

<p>‘That is not it—you are ill.’</p>

<p>‘I am—a little; and don’t bother about it just
now. I’ll tell you how it happened, by-and-by.’</p>

<p>‘How what happened?’</p>

<p>‘I have hurt myself. There now; don’t be
alarmed—it is nothing. You see I am here; and
I don’t want to spoil the evening by letting our
friends know it. Look at the girls; they would
go into fits if things didn’t come off just as they
planned them.’</p>

<p>‘How did you do it?’ she asked calmly.</p>

<p>‘That mare Wrentham bought from Uncle Dick
tumbled over me; that’s all. I’ll be as well as
ever, when I’ve had a little rest.’</p>

<p>‘Have you seen a doctor?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet. The fact is, I was taking a nap at
Wrentham’s, to brace me up for the evening.’</p>

<p>‘You mean that you were insensible?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps that was it. But don’t think about
it. Have some wine?’</p>

<p>When the ladies were retiring, Philip opened
the door for them; but that was the last effort
his strength allowed him to make. He felt giddy
and faint.</p>

<p>‘Help me up-stairs,’ was all he could say to
Dr Joy, who was at his side.</p>

<p>Edwin Joy was a little dark man, but he was
sinewy and active. He wheeled Philip round so
that he placed him easily in a chair near the
table.</p>

<p>‘Don’t stir, anybody,’ he said quickly to the
astounded guests.</p>

<p>‘Drink this,’ he said to Philip, holding a glass
to his lips.... ‘Better?’</p>

<p>Philip nodded.</p>

<p>‘Take a little more. I have been watching
you, and knew there was something wrong.
What have you been doing?’</p>

<p>All this was uttered rapidly, but in a low and
cheery tone, not to alarm the hearers.</p>

<p>‘Riding. The mare was fresh and skittish. The
man warned me that she had been at high feeding
for some days, and getting little to do. But I
knew the mare, and thought I could manage her.
She tried to throw me—then stood bolt upright—lost
balance, and fell back over me.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Feet and legs all right. Where were you
hurt?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I was slipping off; but there
is a queer sensation here.’</p>

<p>The little doctor passed his hands rapidly over
the side to which Philip pointed, and beckoned
to Dr Guy.</p>

<p>The guests had obeyed the doctor’s injunction
not to leave their seats. His words acted like
a charm in a fairy tale, and they were suddenly
spell-bound in the position they occupied when
it was spoken. They looked in dumb astonishment
at the principal actors in this unexpected
scene. The spell was broken by Dr Guy rising
from his seat.</p>

<p>‘What mare was it?’ asked Crawshay, turning
sharply to Wrentham.</p>

<p>‘The one I had from you.’</p>

<p>‘And you were giving her high feed and
nothing to do!... Humph! I used to think
you knew something about horses.’</p>

<p>The yeoman rose with an expression of contempt
and advanced to Philip.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter, lad? Art sore hurt? It
went against the grain to part with that mare;
and I fervently wish she had eaten her head off
at Willowmere, rather than she should have done
this. I wouldn’t have parted with her, neither,
only I thought she was going into safe hands.’</p>

<p>‘Get him into bed,’ said Dr Guy decisively.</p>

<p>‘For any sake, don’t spoil the fun to-night,’
said Philip feebly. ‘My father will make some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">{149}</span>
excuse for me. I fancied I could hold out for a
little longer; but it’s no use.’</p>

<p>‘Do not trouble yourself about that, Philip,’
said Mr Hadleigh. ‘Our friends here will say
nothing to-night, and the young people shall
enjoy themselves as if nothing had happened.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks. Maybe I shall be able to come down
before the fun is all over.’</p>

<p>Supported by Uncle Dick and Dr Guy, and
followed by Dr Joy, Philip proceeded to his
bedroom.</p>

<p>‘This is most unfortunate,’ muttered Wrentham,
looking much distressed. ‘I had no idea the
brute would play such a trick.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh apparently paid no attention to
this. Taking his place at the table, he spoke
quietly:</p>

<p>‘You all heard what my son said, and I need
not ask you to aid me in carrying out his wish.—Pass
the wine, Mr Crowell.’</p>


<p class="p2">And so the crowd of young people who had been
invited to the ‘little dance’ had no hint of the
accident to mar their pleasure. Outside, the
brilliant light shining through the canvas of
the marquee contended for precedence with the
ruddy harvest-moon. Inside, the place was like
an illuminated hall of flowers and plants. Sam
Culver and Pansy with assistants had been at
work for two days here. The dresses, the
wreaths, the feathers, the jewels of the girls
and matrons, with their faces brightened by the
excitement of the moment, formed a living
kaleidoscope, as they moved and mingled in
the dance or promenade. The strains of the
band were heard in the village; and little groups
of village lads and maidens hung around the gates
of Ringsford to listen to the music.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I must be Phil’s deputy for a time
here as well as in the house,’ said Coutts in his
suavest manner to Madge. ‘I hope you don’t
mind very much?’</p>

<p>‘I do mind a great deal,’ she answered with
a frankness which would have been rude in any
one else, and yet in her appeared to be the kindliest
answer to his question. ‘But I suppose I
must go through the first quadrille.’</p>

<p>And reluctantly she did so. When it was over,
and Coutts would fain have retained his position
as deputy, she said:</p>

<p>‘Will you take me to Mr Hadleigh, please?
He is there speaking to the vicar, near the
entrance.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh advanced to meet them, and she,
relinquishing the arm of Coutts, took that of his
father.</p>

<p>‘She requires taming. Poor Phil,’ was the
reflection of the practical-minded Coutts, as he
turned away to bestow his attentions on beauties
who would appreciate them more.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh understood why she desired to
speak to him, and they went outside, walking
slowly across the lawn towards the house.</p>

<p>‘There is no great danger,’ he assured her at
once; ‘but he will probably be a prisoner for a
few weeks. At present his chief idea is that we
should say nothing about it.’</p>

<p>‘I should like to see him—if the doctors will
allow me,’ she said after a brief pause, her head
bowed as if she were studying the long shadows
on the grass.</p>

<p>‘We can ask them.... Are you sorry that
he will not be able to go with the <i>Hertford
Castle</i>?’</p>

<p>‘How can I be otherwise?’</p>

<p>He did not speak for a few seconds—Then:</p>

<p>‘You sometimes puzzle me very much, Miss
Heathcote.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ she asked, looking up, and the moon
shone full on her face. His was in darkness.</p>

<p>‘You seem to wish him to go away.’</p>

<p>‘I have already explained,’ she answered with
a degree of constraint.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I understand,’ he said dreamily. ‘Mine
is a selfish way of considering the matter. I
grudge every moment that what I—prize most,
is out of sight. I suppose it is because we feel
how short the time is we can possess our treasures,
that in growing old we grow selfish.’</p>

<p>‘But you are not an old man, Mr Hadleigh.’
She was trying to find something gentle to say.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I know men who are nearly twice my age
in years and yet are boys compared with me.
I feel very old just now.’</p>

<p>‘But you know his absence will not be long.’</p>

<p>‘True—his absence will not be long.... Here
is Dr Guy.—Well, doctor, what news do you
bring us now?’</p>

<p>They had entered through the conservatory,
and encountered the doctor on the way to seek
his host.</p>

<p>‘He has had a rest, and there is not much harm
done. But it was foolish of him not to lie up
at once and send for us.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Heathcote would like to see him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it won’t do him any harm for her to
see him—especially as it is his wish that she
should; but he ought to be kept as quiet as
possible. I have been sent for; but Joy will stay
as long as may be necessary.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh himself took Madge to the door
of Philip’s room, and it was opened by Mrs Picton,
the housekeeper.</p>

<p>‘That’s her now,’ said Philip. He was lying
on his right side on the bed, his back towards
the door.—‘Now, doctor, give us the ten minutes
you promised.’</p>

<p>‘I trust to you, Miss Heathcote,’ said Dr Joy,
‘not to allow him to move from his present
position until I return; and not to let him speak
too much.’</p>

<p>She bowed. The doctor and Mrs Picton left
the room.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t this a nuisance, Madge?’ began Philip,
by an effort refraining from turning round to
look at her. ‘It upsets everything.’</p>

<p>‘But there is no danger, Philip,’ she answered,
laying her hand soothingly on his head.</p>

<p>‘That’s just it—if it had been a real knock-up,
one could have said, “There’s no help for it,”
and settled down to enjoy a month or two in bed.
But with a mere scratch like this, which only
threatens to be troublesome if you don’t behave
yourself, it’s—well, it’s irritating.’</p>

<p>‘What was it you wanted to say to me, Philip?
You know, we have only a few minutes, and you
heard what the doctor said to me.’</p>

<p>‘O yes, of course.... Are they having a
good time out there?... I can hear the music—there,
they are at the Lancers now—and it
makes my feet go in spite of me. I did hope to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">{150}</span>
have such a jolly time with you, Madge. I had
put my name down for nearly every dance in
the programme.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid we should both have been rather
tired,’ she said, smiling, glad to find him in such
good spirits.</p>

<p>‘The next dance is a waltz.—Ah!’</p>

<p>He had moved his arm incautiously, and a
sharp pang reminded him of his condition. With
that little cry he had uttered, Madge felt the
pang too.</p>

<p>‘I am going away now,’ she said, trying to
speak firmly; ‘I am only doing you harm by
staying.’</p>

<p>‘No, no; don’t go, Madge—the touch of your
hand has done me more good than all their
bandages. I will be quiet. There is something
very particular you have to do for me. (What a
capital band they have got.)’</p>

<p>‘If you speak again about anything except
what you want me to do, I shall leave the
room.’</p>

<p>That quieted him, and he kept still for a
little.</p>

<p>‘I want you to write to Uncle Shield,’ he said
at length tranquilly. ‘If you write to-morrow,
it will be in time for the next mail.’</p>

<p>‘What am I to say to him?’</p>

<p>‘Say that I have attended to all his instructions,
and have everything ready to start in the <i>Hertford
Castle</i> on the sixth, and that I still hope to do
so.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that isn’t possible, Philip.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll see. Tell him next about this accident,
which the doctors say will prevent me from
getting on to my feet for some weeks. I hope
to prove they are wrong; but send him this
warning through you, so that he may not be
disappointed.’</p>

<p>‘Would it not be better that your father or
your brother should send this message?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all. He would not open a letter from
either of them, as he has warned me; and they
would not write one, as I know. I hope to set
that old misunderstanding between my father
and him right some day. Meanwhile, I very
much want you to do this for me.’</p>

<p>‘As you please, Philip.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks, Madge, thanks. Then tell him
particularly that Wrentham’s affairs are all right....
He’s a good fellow, Wrentham. You
remember, I did not like him at first; since I
have come to know him better, I have altered
my opinion. He is a real good fellow, and made
everything in this troublesome business quite
smooth and easy for me. Only I wish he hadn’t
asked me to try that mare to-day, or that I hadn’t
been so unlucky as to agree to do it.’</p>

<p>‘Uncle is very angry about it. He says the
mare has been shamefully treated, for she had no
vice at all when she left him, and he intends to
buy her back.’</p>

<p>‘I hope he won’t.... Now let me see; was
there anything else? No; I have told you all
that I want to say. You will find an envelope
with his full address on the table over there.’</p>

<p>As she was getting the envelope, there was a
tap at the door.</p>

<p>‘That’s the doctor, I suppose,’ muttered Philip
disappointedly. ‘Why, you can’t have been five
minutes here. You won’t be worrying yourself
about this, Madge. I’ll be all right in a few
days.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t speak any more,’ she said, bending over
and touching his somewhat feverish brow with
her lips. ‘I shall be here to-morrow. We are
going home now. Good-night.’</p>

<p>Dr Joy was at the door, waiting to enter.</p>

<p>‘Will you look at him, doctor, and tell me how
he is before I go?’ said Madge softly. The doctor
went in, and after feeling his patient’s pulse,
returned.</p>

<p>‘He has been a little excited. Don’t leave for
half an hour, and I will send a message to
you.’</p>

<p>In half an hour Mrs Picton brought her the
message: Philip was sleeping.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_PARLIAMENTARY_MAIDEN">SOME PARLIAMENTARY MAIDEN
SPEECHES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> have probably been very few members of
parliament who have risen in their place for the
first time without an unpleasant nervous tremor.
Even if a parliamentary neophyte be not, as the
familiar phrase has it, ‘unaccustomed to public
speaking,’ he has certainly been unaccustomed to
such an audience; and to hear himself called
upon by the Speaker to address the first legislative
assembly in the world, is an ordeal which is none
the less trying because it has been voluntarily
courted. Seeing that in past times so large a
number of those returned to parliament have
been comparatively unpractised speakers, the fact
that absolute break-downs in maiden speeches
are rare must be attributed to the sympathetic
encouragement which the House always accords
to the new member. Audiences at St Stephen’s
are fastidious, but they are also kindly; the
maiden speech which is a notorious failure is
generally made such by over-confident fluency
rather than by nervous hesitation; and, to
mention one example only, Lord Beaconsfield’s
early <i>fiasco</i>, the story of which has been told a
hundred times, was not due to nervous timidity,
but to the ambition of a young and clever man,
conscious of power, to achieve a parliamentary
reputation by a single <i>coup</i>.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a few early failures on
record which cannot be thus accounted for. The
maiden speech of Sheridan, who was destined to
become one of the greatest of British orators, was
not exactly a break-down, but its escape from
being such was very narrow. In Sheridan’s case,
the audience was more than usually sympathetic,
for his literary reputation had excited curiosity
and interest; but his indistinctness of utterance
and hesitancy of manner impressed his hearers
with the belief that, great as were his mental
powers, he had not the physical qualifications for
effective speech, and that—to quote the words of
one verdict—‘nature never intended him for an
orator.’ Woodfall, the celebrated parliamentary
reporter, was fond of telling how, at the conclusion
of his speech, Sheridan came up to him,
and asked with evident anxiety what he thought
of his first attempt. Woodfall’s reply was: ‘I
am sorry to say I do not think this is your line;
you had much better have stuck to your former
pursuits.’ This was discouraging; but Sheridan
was not easily discouraged; and his subsequent
career justified the confident boldness of his reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">{151}</span>
to the depreciatory estimate: ‘It is in me,
however, and it shall come out!’</p>

<p>The failure of another distinguished man of
letters, Joseph Addison, was much more complete.
He sat for Malmesbury, in the House of
Commons which was elected in 1708, and rose
once to make a speech; but his diffidence completely
silenced him, and he never made a second
attempt. In the Irish parliament, where Lord
Wharton’s influence procured him a seat for the
borough of Cavan, he made another failure, the
story of which is told by Mr O’Flanagan, whom
we quote at second-hand from Mr G. H. Jenning’s
<i>Anecdotal History of the British Parliament</i>, a
capital compilation, to which we acknowledge a
general indebtedness. ‘On a motion before the
House,’ writes Mr O’Flanagan, ‘Addison rose, and
having said, “Mr Speaker, I conceive,” paused,
as if frightened by the sound of his own voice.
He again commenced, “I conceive, Mr Speaker,”
when he stopped, until roused by cries of “Hear,
hear,” when he once more essayed with, “Sir, I
conceive.” Power of further utterance was denied,
so he sat down amidst the scarcely suppressed
laughter of his brother-members.’</p>

<p>The name of Addison recalls that of Steele; and
one of the most interesting incidents in Steele’s
first brief parliamentary career was the maiden
speech of his young friend Lord Finch, which
began as a break-down, and ended as a success.
In Queen Anne’s time, shortly after Steele’s
election for Stockbridge, a motion was made to
expel him from parliament, on the ground that
in one of his periodical publications he had
‘maliciously insinuated that the Protestant succession
in the House of Hanover was in danger
under Her Majesty’s administration.’ It so
happened that very shortly before this time a
libel directed against Lord Finch’s sister had
been scathingly denounced and exposed in Steele’s
paper the <i>Guardian</i>; and the young nobleman
felt that he could not be silent when
Steele in his turn was attacked. He leaped to
his feet, determined to do his best; but though
his heart was in the right place, he found it very
difficult to get his words there, and after managing
to get out a few confused sentences, he sat
down, utterly discomfited. The failure would
have been unredeemed, had it not been that as
he resumed his seat he exclaimed: ‘It is strange
I cannot speak for this man, when I would readily
fight for him.’ The words were heard all over
the House; and Lord Finch’s audience, though
hostile to Steele, was one which could be trusted
to respond at once, the moment an appeal was
made to its chivalrous instincts. From both
sides of the House came a spontaneous burst of
cheering, which so encouraged the young speaker,
that he rose again to his feet; and this time
made a telling and eloquent speech, which was
the beginning of a successful parliamentary
career.</p>

<p>Many years before the occurrence of this incident,
another failure had been turned into a
success by a happy thought on the part of the
speaker himself, which proved that his break-down
could hardly be attributed to want of
presence of mind. During the latter part of the
seventeenth century, a young man, who was
afterwards to become celebrated as third Earl
of Shaftesbury, and author of <i>Characteristics</i>, sat
in the House of Commons as Lord Ashley. A
bill was introduced to grant the services of counsel
to prisoners tried for high-treason; and though
the proposal was based on the commonest principles
of justice, it found many and bitter opponents.
Lord Ashley, however, was among its
warmest supporters, and rose to argue in its
defence; but, unfortunately, after saying a few
words, he found himself unable to proceed. A
little time was given him to collect his thoughts;
but at last the patience of his hearers was exhausted,
and they called loudly upon him to go
on, when, looking at the Speaker, he said: ‘If,
sir, I, who rise only to give my opinion on the
bill now depending, am so confounded that I
am unable to express the least of what I proposed
to say, what must the condition of that man be
who, without any assistance, is pleading for his
life, and is apprehensive of being deprived of it?’
It may safely be said that the most elaborately
prepared and eloquently delivered oration could
hardly have been more rhetorically effective than
this happily extemporised argument.</p>

<p>A record of oratorical triumphs is less entertaining
than a record of failures; but the stories
of one or two maiden speeches which owed their
success to simple assurance are amusing enough.
Modesty and timidity have not been characteristics
of <i>all</i> the members who have ever sat in
parliament. They do not, for example, seem to
have been very prominent in Mr Lechmere,
afterwards Lord Lechmere, who, on his election
for Appleby, turned round to address the House
immediately after having taken the oath, and
before he had gone through the formality of
taking his seat. Mr Cowper, made Lord Chancellor
in 1707, was not quite so precipitate, but
much more copious in his rhetorical outpourings,
for he spoke three times during his first evening
in the House; and even he was excelled by the
notorious ‘Orator Hunt,’ who on a similar occasion
gave his fellow-members no fewer than six
samples of his peculiar eloquence. The hero
of one of the amusing stories just referred to
was the well-known Thomas Slingsby—generally
shortened to Tom—Duncombe. The speech itself
was an extraordinary affair, being an all-round
attack upon various prominent statesmen, delivered
in a manner which may be described as
fascinatingly impudent; but the funniest thing
about it was the story of its production, which
has been told by Mr Greville. ‘The history of
Tom Duncombe and his speech,’ says this collector
of gossip, ‘is instructive as well as amusing.
Tommy came to Henry de Ros, and told him
that his constituents at Hertford were very anxious
that he should make a speech, but that he did
not know what to say, and begged Henry to
provide him with the necessary materials. He
advised him to strike out something new; and
having received his assurance that he should be
able to recollect anything that he had learned by
heart, and that he was not afraid of his courage
failing, Henry composed for him the speech
which Duncombe delivered.’ What it was in
this story which Mr Greville found instructive,
is not so clear; but its amusing quality may be
readily conceded.</p>

<p>Teetotalers have so many good anecdotes, that
those who take the other side in the great alcoholic
controversy have doubtless made the most of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">{152}</span>
tremendous maiden speech which was delivered in
the House of Lords in the year 1678 by the Lord
Carnarvon of that period, and which was said to
have been inspired entirely by claret. Lord Carnarvon
had been dining, not wisely but too well,
with the Duke of Buckingham; and the Duke,
seeing his condition, induced him, by combination
of raillery and flattery, to pledge himself to address
his brother peers that night upon any subject they
happened to be discussing. The Duke of course
regarded the thing as a capital practical joke, and
doubtless anticipated immense enjoyment from the
flounderings of a half-intoxicated man, who had
never spoken before, and who was not supposed
to have any oratorical gifts even when sober. The
debate was on the impeachment of the Earl of
Danby, then Lord Treasurer; and as soon as
an opening occurred, up rose Lord Carnarvon.
‘My lords,’ he said, ‘I understand but little
of Latin, but a good deal of English, and
not a little of English history; from which
I have learned the mischiefs of such kind of
prosecutions as these, and the ill fate of the
prosecutors. I could bring many instances, and
those very, ancient; but, my lords, I shall go no
farther back than the latter end of Queen Elizabeth’s
reign, at which time the Earl of Essex was
run down by Sir Walter Raleigh; and your lordships
very well know what became of Sir Walter
Raleigh. My Lord Bacon, he ran down Sir Walter
Raleigh; and your lordships know what became
of my Lord Bacon. The Duke of Buckingham,
he ran down my Lord Bacon; and your lordships
know what happened to the Duke of
Buckingham. Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards
Earl of Strafford, ran down the Duke of Buckingham;
and you all know what became of him.
Sir Harry Vane, he ran down the Earl of Strafford;
and your lordships know what became of Sir
Harry Vane. Chancellor Hyde, he ran down
Sir Harry Vane; and your lordships know what
became of the Chancellor. Sir Thomas Osbourn,
now Earl of Danby, ran down Chancellor Hyde;
but what will become of the Earl of Danby, your
lordships best can tell. But let me see the man
that dare run the Earl of Danby down, and we
shall soon see what shall become of him.’ The
assembled peers must have felt as if they were
being swept from their feet by an historical
avalanche, riddled by a fusilade of facts; and the
Duke of Buckingham could only exclaim: ‘The
claret has done the business!’ And indeed it
looks like it, for Lord Carnarvon never had
another such success.</p>

<p>Of course, maiden speeches which are in any
way memorable either for their matter or their
manner, the greatness of their success or the
completeness of their failure, are comparatively
rare. As a rule, the first speech of any member
in either House resembles closely all his succeeding
speeches; it may lack the force and fluency
given by practice, but in its general characteristics
there is nothing exceptional. The able man
shows at least something of his ability; the dull
man lets his hearers into the secret of his dullness.
When Cobbett, the very first night he sat in the
House, began his maiden speech with the words,
‘It appears to me that since I have been sitting
here I have heard a great deal of vain and
unprofitable conversation,’ his fellow-members
probably thought that here was a unique display
of self-sufficient assurance; but when Cobbett
had delivered his second speech, the first was
unique no longer, and when he had spoken half
a dozen times, it had come to be regarded as
comparatively mild. Brougham and Canning,
who both became parliamentary speakers of the
first rank, may perhaps, with Sheridan and
Disraeli, be considered as exceptions to the general
rule just given, for their maiden speeches were
described as failures; but in their cases, all that
probably was meant by the word failure was that
they did not fulfil the expectations which had been
formed. None of Lord Palmerston’s early speeches
seem to have had the brilliance of his later utterances;
but that he made a favourable impression
at starting is proved by the fact that Mr Perceval
offered him the Chancellorship of the Exchequer
when he had only spoken once in the House;
while Earl Grey, Lord Castlereagh, Lord Macaulay,
and the late Lord Derby, who began their
political careers in the House of Commons,
delivered maiden speeches which immediately
gave them a reputation.</p>

<p>During the last half-century, there has been
such a change in the conditions of public life,
that no maiden speech can excite the same
curiosity as of old. One result of the lowering of
the franchise has been to diminish the chances of
any parliamentary candidate who has not some
measure of ease and ability in speaking; and
public meetings of all kinds are so numerous,
that the quality and amount of oratorical talent
possessed by every prominent man become well
known long before he has a chance of displaying
it upon the floor of the House of Commons.
This change is not one to be regretted on the
whole; but of course parliamentary life has lost
one element of interest which it possessed in the
days when a maiden speech might be looked
forward to as a revelation of all kinds of
unsuspected possibilities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MINERS_PARTNER">THE MINER’S PARTNER.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a morning only a couple of days after the
opening of our story, the sun had not yet risen
high enough to strike the plains, which stretched
as far as the eye could reach; but the mountains
were all bright with his rays, from their peaks
down almost to the ‘foothills,’ which, tolerable eminences
in themselves, projected like so many capes
out on the level ground, when a man came to the
opening of a tent and looked out. Although he
gazed across the rugged intervening ground and
out upon the plain, and although sunrise in
Colorado is worth seeing from a position of
vantage, yet it was evident that it was from
no appreciation of the scenery that the man stood
there. From the spot, an irregular line of tents
and huts—or ‘shanties’—led to the centre of
Flume City; while the trenches cut in all directions,
and the odd implements and vessels lying
about, gave ample evidence that this was a mining
camp, or town.</p>

<p>The man was dressed in buckskin—as were
many others, who by this time began to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">{153}</span>
themselves—was tall and dark; of an eager, not
to say cunning aspect; while from beneath his
shapeless hat, his long hair hung straight and
untidy. This description might serve for nine-tenths
of the denizens of the camp, whether of
high or low degree; but there was something in
the aspect of this miner which would have prevented
any expert from classing him with the
lowest and coarsest of his calling. He was evidently
deep in thought, and his meditation found
support in a fashion very common in the United
States—he drew a cake of tobacco from his pocket,
and bit off a corner, as though it had been a biscuit;
then, chewing vigorously, he remained with
his absorbed gaze apparently fixed on the distant
plains.</p>

<p>Presently the canvas of the tent was pushed
aside, and another man came out. This second
man was somewhat shorter than the first, although
yet a tolerably tall man. He was fairer, as could
be seen in spite of his sunburnt and weather-beaten
countenance. His beard was brown, and
was longer and fuller than the first comer’s; and
he was altogether of a thicker, stronger build.
These brief descriptions will serve to introduce
the two partners Rube Steele and Ben, whose
jarring took up so much time at the miners’ convention
two or three nights before, and whose
relation to the whole camp had grown to be of
the most unfriendly character.</p>

<p>‘How long have you been cooling yourself
here?’ asked the second man, who was of course
Ben; ‘and why did you not wake me up?’</p>

<p>‘Reckon I have not been here six minutes,’
replied the other, taking no notice of the second
query. ‘I expect we had better see now about
fixing the breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘You might have done something, instead of
loafing around,’ muttered Ben, who was clearly
in no pleasant mood, although his features bespoke
him a frank, good-tempered fellow enough.
‘Here! I will light the fire.’</p>

<p>In a few minutes the fire was blazing, the
kettle on, and the men, who had scarcely interchanged
another word, were seated, waiting for
the water to boil.</p>

<p>‘Now, Rube,’ suddenly exclaimed Ben, ‘you
know this is my last day here; I mean clearing
out; so this is our time to have a settlement. If
we don’t fix things straight now, we shall not fix
them at all.’</p>

<p>‘They air fixed, ain’t they?’ retorted Rube.
‘You have done considerable as you please; so,
if you don’t like the position, I can’t help it.’</p>

<p>‘You shift too much in your argyment, you
do,’ continued Ben. ‘But say now, right away,
do you mean to pay me those fifteen hundred
dollars or not?’</p>

<p>‘You air unreasonable altogether,’ returned
Rube. ‘Why should I pay fifteen hundred
dollars, because a man who robbed us both has
gone off with twice as much?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t tell me about robbing us both—you
can’t fool me like that!’ angrily exclaimed the
other. ‘I never would trust the man with dust—you
knew it—although he was your friend, and
you could not say enough in his favour. It was
through you he hung around here; and even if
you did not get your half from him, with a big
profit, you are bound in honour to pay me my
share.’</p>

<p>Rube’s eyes assumed for a moment a very ugly
and dangerous look, as his comrade spoke. ‘Seems
to me, pardner Ben,’ he said, ‘that you are gone
wrong altogether in this connection. Two or
three citizens saw the order, and thought it was
in your writing; so did I. Then where does
the blame come in? Fix it how you like, it was
only a mistake, not a fault. And as to my having
shared the plunder with this stranger’——</p>

<p>‘I can’t say you did for certain, of course,’
interrupted Ben. ‘But you have been out of
camp till midnight ever since, and where have
you been all the time? Anyhow, I am fifteen
hundred dollars short; that is a sure thing, and
I want it made up. And what do you mean to
do about it?’</p>

<p>The altercation seemed likely to grow into a
violent quarrel; but one or two miners from the
neighbouring huts came in on matters of business,
and the dispute died out, leaving, however, to
judge from the countenances of the principals,
no great amount of good-will on either side. It
was evident from the conversation of these
visitors, that as Ben was about to leave the camp,
and as the partnership which had existed between
himself and Rube would of necessity cease, they
had resolved to sell their equipment of tools,
mining ‘fixings,’ and tent furniture, all of which
were known to be very complete. This was what
drew the miners to the tent; and among the
visitors, there was a general understanding that
the partners were not separating on good terms;
indeed, most of those who came showed, by their
addressing themselves almost exclusively to one
or the other, a partisanship in the matter. Various
bargains were struck by either partner; but
whatever was done by Ben invariably produced
unfavourable comment from Rube; while Ben
did not attempt to conceal his dislike of nearly
all transactions managed by his partner.</p>

<p>So the day wore on, with no increase of good-will
in the tent; and the interchange of conversation
grew less and less, while it became
more irritating in its tone. Had the men
remained together all day, a quarrel must certainly
have arisen; but this was not the case,
one or other being absent from the tent for the
greater part of the time.</p>

<p>It was while Rube was absent towards the
close of the afternoon, that a miner drew near to
the tent, and from the repeated glances he threw
around him, and the deliberate manner in which
he approached, he seemed to be on his guard
against some danger. At last, when he was very
close to the tent, Ben came to the opening, and
being busied in arranging some of the household
gear which he was removing from the interior,
would not have noticed this new-comer, but that
the latter, in a lower voice than appeared to be
requisite, exclaimed: ‘Ben! hist! Are you alone,
Ben?’</p>

<p>Ben looked up, and apparently recognised the
man, for he smiled as he replied: ‘Yes, Absalom,
I am alone; and quite at your service, if you
want me upon any business.’</p>

<p>The stranger was a little spare man, with a
sufficiently comical cast of features; yet he did
not respond to Ben’s smile, but with a very grave
face, came closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">{154}</span></p>

<p>‘Why, Absalom!’ exclaimed Ben with a grin
of amusement spreading over his face, as he
noticed the little man’s gravity, ‘what is the
matter now? Been playing at “monté” again,
I suppose?’</p>

<p>This allusion to the gambling weakness which
was known to be a feature in poor Absalom’s
character, also failed to diminish the serious cast
of the little man’s countenance.</p>

<p>‘Let us go into the tent and talk,’ said the
stranger, still without any responsive smile on
his lips; and as, with the freedom of camp-life,
he led the way, Ben followed him, wondering and
smiling still at Absalom’s important air.</p>

<p>‘Now, then, Ab,’ he continued, ‘what is it?
Let us have your news first; then we will take a
drink.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know that Bill Dobell is in camp?’
asked Absalom, putting more mystery and importance
into his manner than before.</p>

<p>‘No; I guess I did not know it,’ replied Ben.
‘If so, he had better clear out soon; or before I go,
I will leave a message which will send a dozen of
the boys after him, and will teach him that the
Vigilantes are not dead yet.’</p>

<p>‘It will be too late,’ said the other.—‘Now
tell me, Ben, has not Indian Peter offered to buy
the mules and wagon that you have in Fandango
Gulch? And are you not to meet him there at
sundown to settle the trade?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ replied Ben, still wondering, but
with much less disposition to smile. The little
man’s earnestness had impressed him, and he,
moreover, began to regard the conjunction of
names as ominous.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, Ben,’ continued Absalom, glancing
nervously around him and dropping his voice to
a whisper, ‘it is all a planned thing with Rube,
your pardner, and these other two. You will go
to Fandango Gulch; but you will never leave it
alive! Bill Dobell is to have five hundred dollars
in gold-dust for shooting you; and Indian Peter
is to have something for trapping you down
there.’</p>

<p>‘And Rube?’ asked Ben, in a voice which told
how far he was from doubting this strange
story.</p>

<p>‘Wal, Rube of course is to be the paymaster.
He says you have a sight of plunder in—in those
two valises,’ said Absalom, pointing to a couple
of old but strong travelling-bags in a corner of
the tent. ‘You know best if he is right.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know all this?’ demanded Ben
sternly.</p>

<p>‘I have been having drinks with the boys at
Rattlesnake Claim,’ returned Absalom, ‘and so
have not gone to my own shanty lately. You
know that is a long way outside the city. Two
nights ago, I slept at Big Donald’s. Last night,
I felt real bad, and so I got into Indian Peter’s
shanty. I thought he had left the camp for a
day or two, so I crept under some buffalo robes
to have my sleep. I was woke by some men
talking, and I was about to crawl out, when I
recognised Bill Dobell’s voice; and you know he
has threatened to shoot me at sight, for telling
how he broke the stamp-mill. So I lay low, and
heard Rube settle with them other two. Of
course I made up my mind to tell you, and have
been hanging around here all day to get a chance
of seeing you by yourself. And it is my belief,
Ben, that Rube met Californy Jones on the night
that scallawag went off with your gold-dust.’</p>

<p>‘I feel considerable certain he did,’ returned
Ben; ‘and I have told Rube as much.’</p>

<p>‘I saw Rube meet a man at the Big Loaf Rock,
in the cañon,’ continued Absalom. ‘I knew the
man somewhere, but could not remember him
at the time, and I only saw his back. He had a
dog with him too, which was a good deal on the
growl, so I daren’t go nigh.’ And here Absalom
detailed the adventure with which the reader has
been made acquainted.</p>

<p>‘Bill Dobell in camp! Rube in league with
him and Indian Peter! and Californy Jones hanging
about the cañon!’ exclaimed Ben. ‘Then
my first suspicion was right, and Rube <i>did</i> send
some men into the cañon to shoot me! I thought
he was a long time getting his posse together;
and a pretty collection they were! He had plenty
of time to send his desperadoes on first, and they
were Dobell and Indian Peter, you bet.’</p>

<p>‘I think it’s very likely,’ returned Absalom;
‘for Rube is a bad man; and if he ever knows
what I have told you to-day, he will mark
me.’</p>

<p>‘All right, Absalom. The span of mules and
the wagon in Fandango Gulch are yours; you
can fetch them in the morning. I reckon Rube
won’t interfere with you then, said Ben. ‘It is
near sundown now; so do you clear out, and send
Van Boldvert from Pennsylvania Claim up here,
and the Englishmen from Happy Jack Gulch.
Go quickly.’</p>

<p>The little miner vanished; and Ben waited
until the arrival of the men whom he had summoned,
casting many a glance meanwhile in the
direction from which his treacherous partner
should appear.</p>

<p>Looking out westward across the plains, the
broad red disc of the sun was seen just touching
the horizon, and everything bathed in his last rays
was golden, yet not dazzlingly bright. A peculiar
softness and repose was in the light of the setting
orb. It was almost the time at which he was to
keep his appointment; so, when the men arrived,
wondering at the urgent summons delivered, he
hastily told them the gist of the information he
had received, and suggested that some steps
should be taken to get rid of Bill Dobell, who
was acknowledged to be the most desperate
ruffian of all who infested the mines.</p>

<p>Van Boldvert, who, with all the phlegm and
external apathy of the genuine Pennsylvanian
Dutchmen, had their quiet resolution too, said a
few words indicative of the treatment he intended
to adopt—a process which boded no good either
to Dobell or his accomplice Indian Peter.</p>

<p>‘And how about Rube?’ said one of the
Englishmen from Happy Jack Gulch. ‘What
is to be done with him? It seems to me that he
is the worst of the lot; and if there is to be any
stringing-up, why, string him up first, <i>I</i> say.’</p>

<p>‘You sees how it is,’ responded the Dutchman.
‘Rube is de vorst; dere is not no doubt about dat;
but he has had a good character as yet, and so
far as the miners knows, it is his first offence. So
ve shall shust varn him off; and if he comes
more closer nor sixty miles to dese diggings, ve
shtrings him up. But dese oders—vell, dey are
shust de two vorse men ve ever had here, and ve
settles dem anyhow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">{155}</span></p>

<p>As it was Ben’s own case, it was thought better
that the Vigilantes should work without him.
Had they decided otherwise, not his intended
departure or anything else would have been
allowed to stand in the way; on forfeit of his
own life, he must have accompanied them.</p>

<p>The visitors disappeared; and so short a time
had the conference occupied, that the last rays
of the sun still brightened the evening clouds,
when Ben saw, from the door of his tent, fourteen
or fifteen men leave the city, and stealthily and
in several parties take the line which he well
knew would lead them to Fandango Gulch, where
the treacherous ambush was to have been set for
him.</p>

<p>Taking with him the two valises to which
Absalom had made so startling a reference, Ben
strode across to a hut, mean-looking enough, but
which was somewhat larger than common, and
which was dignified by the words ‘Bank, Post-office,
Mail Depôt,’ being inscribed on boards as
large as the front and sides of the building would
conveniently hold. Having deposited his luggage
with the clerk, he was about to return to his own
tent, when he muttered: ‘I will have a last look
at the old place;’ then turning at once into one
of the numerous ravines which ran close up to
the town, he was speedily at the foot of the low
hills; and a few score yards, easily threaded by
him, amid the intricacies of trenches, mounds,
and pools, brought him to the scene of his last
speculations.</p>

<p>The moon was rising. It is hardly possible to
say so much without adding that it had risen,
as the full-moon, of a size and splendour not seen
in northern climates, would rise there completely
in five minutes; while its light, although softer
and less penetrating than it would be when the
disc was high in the heavens, was enough to
render even the smallest objects visible.</p>

<p>‘I guess there is a deal more metal in this
placer than has ever come out,’ half-murmured
Ben, as he looked at the spot; ‘and I am leaving
a good thing. But it is all for the best. I have
realised more dollars than I shall ever spend, and
I am not so young as I was; and some of the
people here are getting a little tired of me. That
p’isonous Rube was the first, maybe; but he
would not be the last, if I stayed here, to try how
thick my skin is. And I remember that, more ’n
a month ago, a bullet was sent through my hair
by accident. There would be another such accident
soon, I reckon, and as before, no one could
guess whose bullet it might be. Wal, this is the
last time I shall take a survey of this or any other
mine. The water is high to-night.’ He turned,
as he spoke, to look at the pool by which he was
standing; but as he did so, he suddenly ceased
his speech, and instinctively recoiled.</p>

<p>The pool was a little below where he stood—only
some two or three feet; but a kind of beach
or margin lay between him and the water; and
as he turned round, the figure of a man, coming
from behind a mound of earth, which lay on this
margin like a small cliff, emerged into the full
moonlight. The start and broken exclamation
of Ben were repeated by the other.</p>

<p>‘Wal, is that Ben?’ exclaimed the voice of
Rube. ‘Why, hadn’t you got to meet Indian
Peter at the Gulch, to settle about them mules?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ returned Ben briefly; ‘I had.’</p>

<p>‘Ha! you have not been, I estimate,’ continued
Rube. ‘Is the trade off?’</p>

<p>‘I have sent some friends to transact my share
of the business for me,’ said Ben; and either the
ambiguous character of the reply, or its tone,
roused Rube’s suspicions; for he glanced quickly
up at the speaker, with the same cunning, dangerous
look which his face had worn earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>‘I see there’s a good many handles and broken
tools about here, Ben,’ he said, changing the subject.
‘Before I take another pardner, I shall have
a clearing-up.’</p>

<p>‘I think it’s very likely,’ said Ben drily, and
his tone again caused the quick, dangerous look
to come on Rube’s face. The latter had by this
time approached almost to where Ben stood, and
he turned to look, as it seemed, across the pool and
out over the deserted diggings, to the rising moon;
but as he did so, with an almost imperceptible
movement he brought his revolver further to the
front. To any but a practised eye, the movement
would have been entirely concealed; but Ben saw
it, and knew its meaning.</p>

<p>‘Air you going to Fandango Gulch, Ben?’
asked Rube, turning again to his ex-partner. ‘I
reckon Peter will be considerably riled if you
don’t.’</p>

<p>‘As you say, there’s a sight of useful things
lying about here,’ returned Ben, stooping, and
looking at some of the broken implements; ‘and
I had no idea we had left so much. Indian Peter
won’t miss me.’</p>

<p>‘Ain’t you going to meet him, then, and why?’
demanded Rube, with another sinister glance
upward, and another slight hitch forward of his
scabbard—as revolver holsters are usually termed
in the west.</p>

<p>‘Because Indian Peter is in the hands of the
Vigilantes by this time, you traitor and hound!’
burst forth Ben, his smothered passion appearing
to overcome him. ‘So is Bill Dobell; and
so’——</p>

<p>His sentence was never finished, for both men
dashed savagely at each other at the same moment.
Rube, when he heard the words which told him
that his plot was discovered and defeated, with
a bitter oath jerked his pistol from its scabbard,
cocked, and fired; but though he did it almost
instantaneously, the hawk-eye of Ben was too
quick for him, and the aim, which must have
been deadly, so close were they together, was
balked by a powerful stroke with the handle
of a pick, which Ben had secured under the feint
of examining the refuse implements. As Rube
levelled his pistol, Ben dealt him a desperate
blow on the back of the head. The weapon
exploded harmlessly in the air; and Rube, with
a single groan, stumbled forward and fell senseless
and motionless on his face.</p>

<p>He lay on the margin or beach described as
being between the elevated ledge and the pool;
and there was something in the helpless, inanimate
figure which convinced Ben that his stroke
had taken deadly effect.</p>

<p>‘I believe he is dead,’ he said, after a pause,
during which he grasped his club in readiness
for another blow. ‘I was sorry I had left my
six-shooter behind, when I saw what he was
after; but this has done as well. Let me make
sure.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">{156}</span></p>

<p>He lifted up the prostrate man’s arm; and
when he released it, it fell heavily and clod-like,
just as it was dropped. He turned the body
half round and placed his hand over the heart,
but could feel no pulsation.</p>

<p>‘The Vigilantes have been saved some trouble,
either now or at another time, anyhow,’ he
continued. ‘I hope they have caught Indian
Peter and Bill Dobell, and then the camp has
got quit of the three worst characters in it. I
shall say nothing about this before I clear out.
I have so many dollars in my satchels, that a
very little would serve as an excuse to Rube’s
friends for lynching me.’</p>

<p>Acting on this determination, he quietly
returned to the camp, or city, where he soon
learned that justice had overtaken Bill Dobell
and Indian Peter. In further confirmation, the
driver of the mail, as he drove from the town,
some hours later in the night, showed him, as an
object of interest, two figures pendent from the
boughs of a solitary tree some hundred and fifty
yards from the roadside, which tree had, it
appeared, often served such a purpose before.</p>

<p>The driver, having come on from a distant
station with the coach, was not so well acquainted
with the antecedent particulars of this demonstration
of justice, as was the passenger who sat
by his side on the box; nor did he know the
latter’s interest in the matter.</p>

<p>‘I do hear,’ continued the driver, ‘that Rube
Steele was looked for to make a third; but it is
calculated he made tracks in time. It is a good
thing to get rid of such desperadoes as Bill Dobell
and Indian Peter; but it’s an awful pity they
missed Rube.’</p>

<p>The outside passenger kept his own counsel,
being very well satisfied that his partner’s fate
should remain unknown until he had placed at
least a hundred leagues between himself and the
mining town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONCERNING_LOVE">CONCERNING LOVE.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="PART I.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Love</span> is a stupendous paradox. You cannot
elaborate a theory with regard to it which shall
be at once entirely consistent in itself and all-comprehensive
in its application. You may note
its manifestations, estimate its force, trace its
progress, and speculate upon its potentialities;
but how can you hope to reduce to a self-consistent
philosophy its thousand-and-one contrarieties
and its endless shades of diversity—its
glowing triumphs, its merry comedies, its sad irrevocable
catastrophes—its sweet reasonableness, its
wild infatuation, and its incomprehensible eccentricities?
There is perhaps no subject under the
sun which has been a more constant theme of
poets, essayists, and philosophers; but what is
the net result of all that these have told us? It
is a long category of heterogeneous and conflicting
dicta or speculations, comprising, it is true, many
sage reflections, accurate observations, and charming
fancies, but, as a whole, presenting rather the
aspect of a kaleidoscopic view than that of an
intelligible and harmonious picture.</p>

<p>Though the praise of love has been more
common than its disparagement, there are not
wanting those who have been disposed to treat
the subject with irony and ridicule. It was
Laurence Sterne who said that the expression
‘fall in love’ evidently showed love to be beneath
a man. This was no doubt intended for nothing
more than a facetious play upon the words; but
there are numerous writers, both before and after
Sterne, who have ridiculed the votaries of the
tender passion and disparaged the god Cupid.
Bacon speaks of love as ‘this weak passion,’ and
quotes with approval the remark, that ‘it is impossible
to love and be wise.’ Cervantes satirises
the extravagances of the amorous passion to the
top of his bent in the adventures of his mad hero
Don Quixote, in whose fantasy and mock-heroic
panegyrics love is a never-absent theme; indeed,
it is an essential element of his madness, for he
is made to declare that ‘the knight-errant that
is loveless resembles a tree that wants leaves and
fruit, or a body without a soul.’</p>

<p>Certain of Shakspeare’s creations also join in
this detraction, and the lover and the lunatic
are placed in the same category, as—with the
poet—‘of imagination all compact;’ while one
of his characters—the fair Rosalind—declares:
‘Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you,
deserves as well a dark house and a whip as
madmen do.’ The affinity of love and madness
has formed the subject of much learned disquisition,
and the general testimony would seem to
show that there must be numerous instances in
which it might be said, adapting Dryden’s couplet
on the subject of ‘great wits:’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Great love is sure to madness near allied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thin partitions do the bounds divide.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Carlyle remarks that ‘love is not altogether a
delirium; yet it has many points in common
therewith.’ From the illustrations that are constantly
set before us, it would appear that the
chief point in common between love and madness
or delirium is that in both cases the victim becomes
more or less devoid of the power of self-control,
and, in his or her infatuation, indulges in the
most serious or ludicrous extravagances.</p>

<p>The evidence would seem to indicate that
Reason, in the presence of Love, is obliged to
descend from her throne, and pay tribute to
what has become the dominating motive. When
Love takes possession, it subsidises and controls
the judgment, tastes, faculties, and inclinations
of the individual, and is not to be argued down,
even by the subject himself, much less by others.
In the words of Addison:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love is not to be reasoned down, or lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In high ambition, or a thirst of greatness;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis second life—it grows into the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Warms every vein, and beats in every pulse.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From whatever point of view we approach this
theme, we soon encounter what is, perhaps, after
all, the most prominent and least dubitable characteristic
of love—namely, its far-reaching, all-pervading
potency. Bacon, with all his philosophical
acumen, is obviously wrong when he
describes love as a ‘weak passion;’ indeed, the
phrase itself is a contradiction in terms. Voltaire
is much more just in his estimate when he says:
‘Love is the strongest of all the passions, because
it attacks at once the head, the heart, and the
body.’</p>

<p>What Bacon evidently intended to refer to was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">{157}</span>
the weakness, not of the passion, but of the will
which could not repel or subdue it. This view
is borne out by the context, which is, that ‘great
spirits and great business do keep out this weak
passion.’ This contention, however, is no more
tenable than his characterisation. All the evidence
goes to prove that love is not to be conquered
by great spirits, or smothered by great
business, any more than it is to be reasoned down.
As the French proverb says: ‘Close the door in
Love’s face, and he will leap in at the window;’
and the aphorism is equally applicable to mental
and material obstructions. In the same way
Shakspeare teaches that ‘stony limits cannot
hold love out;’ that ‘the more thou dam’st it
up, the more it burns;’ and that ‘Love is your
master, for he masters you.’</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no aspect of this passion
regarding which so great unanimity prevails as
that expressed in those last quotations. It is
Scott who declares that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He who stems a stream with sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fetters flame with flaxen band,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has yet a harder task to prove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By firm resolve to conquer Love.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Southey, who is convinced that ‘love is indestructible,’
goes so far as to assert that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They sin who tell us Love can die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If further evidence of the vitality and power of
this passion were required, an appeal might be
made to the language of Hebrew Scripture, which
teaches that ‘Love is strong as death.... Many
waters cannot quench love, neither can floods
drown it.’</p>

<p>In view of testimony like this, one might be
pardoned for supposing the point in question satisfactorily
established. We shall not, however,
have proceeded far in the consideration of other
phases of the subject, before we shall come upon
views which it is by no means easy to reconcile
with the above conclusions. Take, for example,
the theory that a man or a woman can truly love
but once. This would seem to be the natural
corollary of the belief that love is indestructible.
The argument, of course, is that the love which
departs is not love at all. As the old lines
run:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray, how comes Love?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It comes unsought, unsent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray, how goes Love?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That was not love that went.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Carlyle homologates this view. In <i>Sartor Resartus</i>,
he says: ‘As your Congreve needs a new case
or wrappage for every new rocket, so each human
heart can properly exhibit but one love, if even
one; the “first love which is infinite” can be
followed by no second like unto it.’</p>

<p>This is certainly a strong case for the first-and-only-love
theory. But let it not be supposed that
we shall here miss the inevitable differences of
opinion. Among others who raise a strong protest
against this view is George Eliot, who believes
there is a second love which is greater, because
more mature, than the first. ‘How is it,’ she
asks, ‘that the poets have said so many fine things
about our first love, and so few about our later
love? Are their first poems the best? or are
not those the best which come from their fuller
thought, their larger experience, their deep-rooted
affections? The boy’s flute-like voice has its own
spring charm; but the man should yield a richer,
deeper music.’ Many other quotations to a
similar purport might be given; but the whole
argument is a futile one. It is simply reasoning
in a circle, because, whatever may be advanced
on this side of the question, it is of course perfectly
open to those who maintain the opposite
to fall back upon the contention that the love
which was vanquished was not love at all, and
that its subjugation sufficiently proves that it
was spurious.</p>

<p>It may be said that this is a somewhat rough-and-ready
method of disposing of a profound and
delicate psychological problem, and the point
may be further raised in connection with the
kindred proposition, that love is not incurable.
Those who hold that love is indestructible must
also, in consistency, maintain that it is likewise
incurable, and inconsolable when scorned and
rejected. Then, of course, they are met with
declarations like that of Shakspeare when he
says: ‘Men have died from time to time, and
worms have eaten them, but not for love;’ or
like that of Thackeray, when he remarks that
‘Young ladies have been crossed in love, and
have had their sufferings, their frantic moments
of grief and tears, their wakeful nights, and so
forth; but it is only in very sentimental novels
that people occupy themselves perpetually with
this passion; and, I believe, what are called
broken hearts are very rare articles indeed.’</p>

<p>At the same time, there are not many who
agree that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis better to have loved and lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than never to have loved at all.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Guarini, in his <i>Faithful Shepherd</i>, expresses a
directly opposite opinion, holding that it is far
harder to lose his lady-love than never to have
seen her or called her his own. Hamlet speaks
heavily enough of ‘the pangs of despised love;’
and it would be idle to deny that a large proportion
of the tragedies of real life, as well as of
fiction, have turned upon love rejected, abused,
or betrayed. When Dryden says that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pains of love be sweeter far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than all other pleasures are,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he must not be supposed to refer to the love that
has been blighted by cold neglect or open disdain.
Burns describes the pains of love when parted
from its object in very different language—as
‘A woe that no mortal can cure.’ Dryden’s
reflection is rather in the same strain as that of
the love-sick Hibernian who said it was ‘a
moighty recreation to be dying of love. It sets
the heart aching so delicately there’s no taking
a wink of sleep for the pleasure of the pain.’
Moore gives a less paradoxical and more serious
exposition of the case than his love-sick compatriot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes—loving is a painful thrill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And not to love more painful still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But surely ’tis the worst of pain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To love and not be loved again.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Various specifics have been prescribed for the
cure of love, and among these, matrimony has
been suggested as an infallible cure. A grim
joke, my masters! but one in which there is only
a certain modicum of truth. Whether, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">{158}</span>
the love is spurious, or because its fire is less
unquenchable than the poets would have us
believe, it is yet too true, and one of the saddest
facts of human experience, that the love which
glows so bright and radiant on the wedding morn,
may, before many years have flown, be cold and
dead as the ashes of a fire that has long gone
out.</p>

<p>When the idol is shattered, and love neither
dies nor breaks the heart, it sometimes—and here
is another enigma—changes its nature; becomes,
in fact, the opposite of itself. The operation is
not without analogy. The arch-fiend himself was
once an angel of light, and so we may find
adoring love become venomous hate.</p>

<p>It is a profitless task to apply the why and the
wherefore to love-affairs. Byron, who himself
knew so much about love, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why did she love him? Curious fool, be still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is human love the growth of human will?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To assume that it is, would only remove the
problem still further from the point of solution,
and would seem, in many instances, to bring the
lover and the madman into still closer relationships.
It is the infatuation of love, and not the
prompting of reason, that causes men and women—but
how much more frequently the latter!—to
give up, often for a worthless object, friends,
happiness, reputation, wealth, and all that life
holds dear—even, in some cases, life itself. ‘The
hind,’ says Shakspeare, ‘that would be mated with
the lion, must die for love;’ yet such unions and
such sacrifices are by no means uncommon—not
in the lower animal kingdom, but in the more
exalted and more tangled scheme of human affairs.
Still, despot as he is, with all his huge blunders
and strange tyrannies, Love is perhaps the most
welcome and beneficent guest that knocks at the
door of the human heart. Reason has her own
place and her own functions; but it is to Love,
after all, that we must look for the most generous
impulses, the noblest inspirations. It is Love that
redeems our life from cold prosaic dullness, that
sweetens and enriches all its springs. There is no
more refining and ennobling influence in the life
of man than that of a pure unselfish love.
From such flows every kind of mutual sympathy,
mutual comfort, mutual helpfulness. It is the
highest realisation of human bliss.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_NEW_PROCESS_OF_WHITE-LEAD">A NEW PROCESS OF WHITE-LEAD
MANUFACTURE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two former articles (June 16 and November
10, 1883) we noticed the dangers to life and
health which accompany the manufacture of
white-lead as at present carried on, and we
reviewed the several attempts made to find a
substitute. We are still of opinion that such substitutes
will prove effectual in their measure; but
we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the
enormous production and consumption of ordinary
white-lead must nevertheless continue, chiefly
on account of its cheapness, for its enduring
qualities, and for its capability for purposes
in jointing, calking, machinery and hydraulic
use, which other substances fail to fulfil. In
these circumstances it is interesting to know
that almost coincident with the Report of Mr
Redgrave, C.B., Her Majesty’s chief Inspector of
Factories—to which we alluded in a former article
(June 16), and which so forcibly shows the evils
under the old ‘stack’ process of white-lead manufacture,
as usually carried on—there has been
discovered, and brought into full operation, a
process by which white-lead of the purest and
best quality is produced in one-sixth the time,
and at considerably less cost than under the old
process. The necessity for the work of women
is also avoided, and the operatives completely
secured from contact with the dangerous white-lead
dust.</p>

<p>It may help our readers to an understanding
of the subject if we quote first a brief description
of the ‘stack’ process, from a <i>previous</i>
Report by Mr Redgrave: ‘The lead is received
in “pigs.” These are melted in a furnace, and
then cast in water or in moulds of various forms
best suited for the action of the acetic acid.
The acid is placed in pots of earthenware, on
which the moulded lead is placed; and the pots
are then arranged in large chambers, called
“stacks,” and covered with tan. Row after row
of pots and tan are placed one above the other,
until the stack is full, in which condition the
stack remains for about three months. Carbonic
acid gas is evolved during this time, escaping
through the ventilators, and causes the deposit
of white-lead on the moulds of lead. If the above
were the only process, it would be comparatively
innocuous; but it is the work that succeeds from
which the evil of lead-poisoning arises. The tan
is carefully removed from layer after layer;
white-lead is found caked upon the moulds of
lead; but a very little motion causes it to break
up into powder. The lead, loaded with this
deposit, is then carried in trays, and emptied
into cisterns of water, through which, by agitation,
the white-lead passes to the grinding-mills, and
the blue lead is raked out of the cisterns for
further use. After being ground in the wet state,
the material is placed in pans and carried into
the ovens to be dried; it is then carried from the
ovens to the warehouse, to be packed in barrels.
Such are the principal processes in which females
are employed, and which are most prolific of
disease and death. The injuries to health arise
from the external contact with the skin of the
white-lead, whether in the dry or moist condition,
and the inhalation of the dust or powder into
the lungs, or its being imbibed into the stomach
through the mouth. As for the prevention,
external or internal, no means have yet been
discovered by which this could be attained.
The mitigation of the evil lies in excessive and
enforced cleanliness, with the use of special
clothing and appliances when at work.’</p>

<p>When, however, the testimony given in Mr
Redgrave’s <i>later</i> Report is considered, it will be
seen that the ‘excessive and enforced cleanliness,
with the use of special clothing and appliances,’
fail to accomplish their object, the chief reason
being, as testified by one sufferer: ‘The air of
the factory was always full of white-lead dust.’
Another, speaking of her clothes, said: ‘Dust came
from them like a miller, and used nearly to choke
me.’ And managers of factories state to Mr
Redgrave: ‘Respirators are provided, but work-people
as a rule will not wear them. The respirators
are troublesome.’ The fact is, there is this
dilemma: without the respirators, lungs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">{159}</span>
stomach get filled with the dangerous white-lead
dust; with the respirators, the perspiring, half-choked
women cannot work. The problem really
is how to produce white-lead without raising this
poisonous dust, as it is well known that the
grinding in oil is with any ordinary care perfectly
innocuous. The very stringent legislation lately
authorised does not touch this point.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to produce white-lead
by precipitation, and thus to avoid some of
the dangers; but the product is an inferior one,
being composed of minute crystals which will
not blend with the oil, and are deficient in the
most important qualities necessary for paint, and
for the other purposes for which true white-lead
is largely used. The precipitated lead has also
to be washed and stored, as the white-lead from
the stack process.</p>

<p>Happily, just at this juncture a simple but
wonderful process has been discovered, perfected
and patented by Professor E. V. Gardner, of 44
Berners Street, London, W., for many years
Director of the Scientific Department, and Professor
of Chemistry to the Royal Polytechnic
Institution, and who marches with the age in the
application of the wonderful power of electricity
to this branch of manufacture. He avails himself
to the full of that great representative of all
energy in forming what is called a galvano-electric
combination in the process of manufacture of
white-lead, as follows:</p>

<p>The metallic lead, cast into the form of
gratings, and bent into narrow arches, is closely
ranged in order upon wooden trays covered with
pure sheet-tin—the most practically useful electro-negative
to be had. Dipped by mechanical contrivance
into a certain acid mixture, to give a
chemically clean surface, and to promote the
after-process of corrosion, they are placed in
chambers built of brick, from twelve feet square
and upwards, having a glass roof and windows
for observation, and having a floor of the electro-negative
and highly electro-conductive tin heated
from beneath by steam to the necessary temperature
of about one hundred and twenty degrees
Fahrenheit. These chambers may each contain as
small a quantity as from eight to ten tons of lead,
and range up to eight hundred or a thousand tons.
Gases, composed of a mixture of acetic acid vapour
and atmospheric air at a similar temperature, are
introduced by stoneware pipes from an ingenious
apparatus where they are generated; and passing
through holes in the pipes a few inches from the
tin-covered floor of the chamber, they pass upward,
and permeating the whole chamber, electric
action commences. At the end of the second day,
there is a beautifully white surface. On the
third day, carbonic acid vapour is introduced by
the same means, hastening still more the formation
of white-lead. This goes on for two weeks,
at the close of which time, so active has been the
action of the substances engaged, by reason of
the electrical energy, that there is more white-lead
formed than under three months’ working
of the same amount of lead by the old process.
The gases are then shut off, the chamber cooled,
ventilated, opened, and the contents withdrawn,
the trays being emptied through a special hopper
into the ‘agitator,’ a horizontal cage of round iron
bars revolving in a closed case. After being rotated
a few minutes, the whole of the white-lead is
disengaged, and falls into a pit underneath,
leaving the cores that have not been converted
in the cage, from which they are collected and
remelted for further use. From the pit, the
white-lead is conveyed to the mill by an endless
band, on which are fixed a number of small
buckets, which, filling themselves with the white-lead
as they pass through the pit at the bottom,
discharge it into the mill as they turn over at
the top, whence, after passing through the crushing-rollers,
the white-lead falls into the mixer, and
issues forth, when combined with oil, in the shape
of white-lead of one unfailing quality, being of
perfect character as to body and testing powers,
and of the purest colour.</p>

<p>The work is continuous from first to last. As
all the apparatus is carefully closed in, there is no
dust, nor do the hands of the operatives once touch
the material. <i>The Sanitary Record</i> (October 1883)
says: ‘Professor Gardner has completely revolutionised
the manufacture of white-lead. Not only
has he rendered it a comparatively innocuous
industry, but he has made it a much simpler process,
and reduced the time hitherto required for
its production in an extraordinary manner, and so
facilitated its rapid make, and at a much lessened
cost of production. But these great advantages
of the process sink into insignificance when compared
with its hygienic working in rescuing
hundreds of poor creatures from lingering illness,
not taking into account the attendant expense
of their treatment and support, which falls on
various local authorities.’</p>

<p>Mr Redgrave, having carefully inspected the
working of the process, has written to Professor
Gardner as follows: ‘I think it right to state
that having carefully inspected your works at
the bottom of Rolt Street, Deptford, it appears
to me that the process of the manufacture of
white-lead there is free from nearly all the objections
on the score of exposure of the persons
employed to the injurious effects, hitherto deemed
to be inseparable from the occupation. The material
and the product are alike isolated, there is
an absence of dust, and handling or manipulating
is unnecessary.’</p>

<p>As the white-lead manufacturers of our country
are not only an influential and wealthy body,
alive to their own interest, but also most anxious
for the welfare of their operatives, they must
hail this new process with much interest, and
adopt it gladly. The general public will rejoice
to be assured that the valuable and useful white-lead
is no longer prepared at the cost of life
and health to many, especially women, as has
hitherto been the case.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SENSITIVE_PLANT">THE SENSITIVE PLANT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> singular phenomenon exhibited by this well-known
exotic has long been the admiration of
the curious, a puzzle to the botanist, and a
standing marvel in the vegetable kingdom. The
plant has the property of contracting certain parts
of its structure when touched, and is not only
sensible to the application of force, but appears
to be influenced by the surrounding elements.
Sudden degrees of heat or cold, steam from boiling
water, sulphur-fumes, the odour of volatile liquids,
in fact anything that affects the nerves of animals,
appears also to affect the sensitive plant. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">{160}</span>
in the highest degree a nervous subject, and, like
that species of the genus <i>homo</i>, is in this country
a thorough hothouse habitant. The subject of our
present consideration was originally introduced
from Brazil, and, along with other varieties possessing
the same faculty in different degrees, is
common to other parts of South America. The
stem of the plant is cylindrical, and of a green or
purplish colour, with two spines at the base of
each leaf, besides a few others scattered about the
branches. The leaves are pinnatifid, or divided
into pairs, supported on long footstalks, and each
pinnule is furnished with fifteen or twenty pairs of
oblong, narrow, and shining leaflets. From the
base of the leaf-stalks proceed the peduncles or
flower-stalks, each of which supports a bunch of
very small white or flesh-coloured flowers. The
seed-vessels are united in packets of twelve or
fifteen each, and are edged with minute spines,
each husk containing three little seeds.</p>

<p>Dr Hook, Dufay, Duhamel, and other naturalists,
have studied this plant with equal attention,
and from their observations we learn that
it is difficult to touch a leaf of a healthy mimosa—under
which name the sensitive plant is also
known—even in the most delicate manner without
causing it to close. The great nerve which
passes along the centre of the leaf serves as a
hinge for the sides to close upon, and this they
do with great exactness, the two sides exactly
opposing each other. If the pressure is made
with considerable force, the opposite leaf of the
same pair will be affected at the same time and
moved in the same manner. Upon squeezing the
leaf still harder, all the leaflets on the same side
close immediately, as if resenting the affront.
The effect may be even carried so far that the
leaf-stalk will bend to the branch from which
it issues, and the whole plant collect itself
as it were into a bundle.</p>

<p>As soon as evening approaches, the sensitive
plant begins to lower its leaves, till at length
they rest upon the stem. With the morning
light, they gradually re-open. When the leaves
have even faded and turned yellow, the plant
still continues this action, and retains its sensibility
when agitated by external influences. A
fine rain will not disturb the mimosa at all; but
should the rain fall heavily, and be accompanied
by wind, the plant becomes immediately affected.
When irritated and made to close by force, the
time necessary for the leaves to recover their
usual position varies from ten to twenty minutes,
according to the season and the hour of the
day.</p>

<p>Though heat and cold contribute greatly
towards its alternate motion, yet the plant is
more sluggish in its movements and less sensitive
in winter than in summer. After a branch
has been separated from the shrub, the leaves
still retain their sensibility, and will shut on
being touched. If the end of the detached branch
is kept in water, the leaves will continue to act
for some time.</p>

<p>If the sensitive plant be plunged into cold
water, the leaves will close, but will afterwards
re-open; and if touched in this state, will again
shut themselves, as if in the open air, but not
so quickly. This experiment does not seem to
injure the plant. If the extremity of a leaf
exposed to the rays of the sun is burned with a
lens or a match, it closes instantly; and at the
same moment, not only the leaflet which is
opposite to it follows its example, but all that
are upon the same stalk. If a drop of sulphuric
acid is placed upon a leaf so as to remain
stationary, the plant is not immediately affected;
but when it begins to spread, the irritation is
communicated from one leaflet to another, till
the whole of them on the affected stalk are closed.
Although a branch of this wonderful plant be
cut through three-fourths of its diameter, yet the
leaves belonging to it retain the same degree of
sensibility, and open and shut with their usual
freedom. The vapour of boiling water affects the
leaves in the same manner as if they were burned,
and for several hours they appear benumbed—in
fact, seldom recovering during the remainder
of the day.</p>

<p>These are some of the principal phenomena
connected with this very singular plant. No
doubt, other experiments have been made; but
these will serve to show how much akin is the
delicate organisation of this plant to that of the
animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Many conjectures have been formed and many
theories raised to account satisfactorily for the
working of this exquisite machine; but the mainspring
is still hidden, and has, as far as we know,
eluded the search of the naturalist. It has been
supposed by some that the mimosa is endued
with a power of perception which actuates all
its motions, and is the connecting link between
the animal and vegetable kingdoms. But at least
an equally rational theory is, that its movements
are purely mechanical. To enter into a discussion
as to the relative merits of these and other theories
would exceed the limits of this article. We can

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
